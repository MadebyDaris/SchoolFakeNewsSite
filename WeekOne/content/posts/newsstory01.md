# Bigfoot caught on camera
“My friend and I got permission to fly our drones at Salt Fork State Park in Ohio,” one of the men writes, in a post accompanying the video. “While we were there we heard many strange noises and we believe we may have found the Ohio Grassman/Bigfoot/Sasquatch.”

Ohio Grassman is a local nickname for Bigfoot.

Bigfoot has become better known and a phenomenon in popular culture, and sightings have spread throughout North America. Rural areas of the Great Lakes region and the Southeastern United States have been sources of numerous reports of Bigfoot sightings, in addition to the Pacific Northwest.[22] In the Bigfoot Casebook, authors Janet and Colin Bord document the sightings from 1818 to 1980, listing over 1,000 sightings.  


In North American folklore, Bigfoot or Sasquatch are said to be hairy, upright-walking, ape-like creatures that dwell in the wilderness and leave footprints. Depictions often portray them as a missing link between humans and human ancestors or other great apes. They are strongly associated with the Pacific Northwest, particularly Oregon, Washington, British Columbia and Northern California.

Two stunned hikers in eastern Ohio may have spotted the creature, capturing the strange sight on camera. The two men claim to have spotted the yeti in Salt Fork State Park. The video of the Sasquatch has since gone viral.
