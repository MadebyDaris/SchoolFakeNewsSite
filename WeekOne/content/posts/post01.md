GEMS Metropole School is a supportive and caring community. It is easily accessible to parents from nearby communities with over 100 nationalities in the school. Every teacher, Learning Support Assistant and member of the admin and premises team, act as role models in order for children to achieve the highest standards. Alongside our dedicated staff, are our community of parents and carers who come from a wide range of cultures and backgrounds. We strive to work closely with parents as we know when school and home work together, their children achieve their very best. We hold many events and sessions throughout the year where parents are invited into school.

## Themed morning

Spiritual Sunday: On this day the Metropole community hear soft calming music. This has been proven to lower anxiety and stress levels; increase positive moods; allow for better decision making and allows time for students to reflect and be thankful.

Music Monday: The music department treat us every Monday to the sound of musical instruments, please do stop and listen, music has a relaxing effect on us and helps with our wellbeing. 

Techy Tuesday: The IT department have their IT students who are our Tech Gurus available every Tuesday. The gurus will help you understand new features on the devices.

Wacky Wednesday: This day, led by the Science and Art departments, introduces us to wonderful days of quick and wacky experiments.

Topical Thursday: The plan is to have a Metro Radio station, but whilst this project takes off, we will record students each week to discuss their lessons, learning and what they found interesting. This project is led by the Media subject students who spend their week recording students across the school.
